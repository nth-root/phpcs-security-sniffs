# phpcs-security-sniffs

phpcs-security-sniffs is a collection of security-focused sniffs for
[PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/).
These sniffs will report security vulnerabilities in your PHP code.

This project is inspired
by [phpcs-security-audit](https://github.com/FloeDesignTechnologies/phpcs-security-audit),
a similar but no longer maintained project.
